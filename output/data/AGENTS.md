## Role

Generated analysis data (CSV/NPZ/JSON) emitted by project analysis stages.

## Layout

- Files: `manuscript_variables.json`, `publication_ledger.json`, `test_coverage_summary.json`

## Invariants

- Repository-wide policy for template projects is maintained in the template repository, not restated here.
- Generated outputs in these trees are regenerable via the repo's canonical
  pipeline; do not hand-edit artifacts to "fix" results.
- This repo lives in the public docxology mirror — anything written here
  becomes public once pushed to the repo's GitHub remote.

## Gotchas

- No silent omissions: if a child folder above is undocumented, that is a
  known gap of this auto-generated doc — replace it with a verified
  description when you work here.
