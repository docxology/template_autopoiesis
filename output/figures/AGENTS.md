# AGENTS.md — `template_autopoiesis/output/figures`

> Generated 2026-08-29 during the ongoing-docs fleet pass. Description derived

## Role

Generated figure files (PNG/SVG) referenced by the manuscript render.

## Layout

- Child folders: `mermaid_inline/`
- Files: `cover_art.png`, `fig_coverage_by_module.png`, `fig_domain_coverage.png`, `fig_product_space.png`, `fig_stacked_product.png`, `figure_registry.json`

## Invariants

- Local-only path under `projects/ongoing/` (root `.gitignore` rule
  `projects/*`) — never commit. Repo-wide policy: see
  `/Volumes/external_drive/Git/template/projects/ongoing/AGENTS.md`.
- Generated outputs in these trees are regenerable via the repo's canonical
  pipeline; do not hand-edit artifacts to "fix" results.
- This repo lives in the public docxology mirror — anything written here
  becomes public once pushed to the repo's GitHub remote.

## Gotchas

- No silent omissions: if a child folder above is undocumented, that is a
  known gap of this auto-generated doc — replace it with a verified
  description when you work here.
